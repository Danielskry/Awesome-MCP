# üòé Awesome Model Context Protocol (MCP) 
[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This repository is a curated list of resources, tools, documentation, and community projects related to the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol). An open protocol for managing memory, shared context, and stateful collaboration across Large Language Models (LLMs), tools, and user interfaces.

MCP bridges the gap between AI agents and real-world data, enabling dynamic, secure, and modular interactions across sessions and systems. By standardizing how context is exchanged between clients (LLM-powered applications) and servers (data sources, APIs, or tools), MCP makes it easier to build intelligent, context-aware applications that can adapt over time.

## üìñ What is MCP?
The Model Context Protocol (developed by [Anthropic](https://github.com/anthropics)) defines a universal framework for how LLM-powered applications (clients) interact with data, tools, and services (servers) in a secure and standardized way. It does so through a [client-host-server pattern](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/architecture), which will enable us to:
- Utilize tools to perform custom actions and execute tasks (similar to `POST`/`PUT` requests)
- Establish resources that can retrieve data and load data into context (similar to `GET` requests) 
- Design custom LLM prompts and define interactions (e.g., resuable templates)
- And more...

## üñ•Ô∏è Servers
- [Model Context Protocol Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers): a collection of reference implementations for MCP and servers that are community built.
